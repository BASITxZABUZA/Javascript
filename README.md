## Introduction

This repository is a personal collection of JavaScript exercises, examples, and notes. Itâ€™s structured to help me systematically learn JavaScript, starting from the basics and gradually covering more advanced topics. I will continually update the repository as I progress, adding more topics and examples for better understanding.

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific JavaScript concept:

- **Arrays**: Contains examples and exercises related to array manipulation in JavaScript.
- **Loops**: Includes code samples demonstrating various looping constructs.
- **Objects**: Features examples on object creation and manipulation.
- **Functions**: Provides examples on how to create and use functions in JavaScript.
- **Conditionals**: Contains examples of how to use `if`, `else`, `switch`, and ternary operators.

Each folder contains:
1. `.js` files with practical examples and exercises.
2. A `README.md` file providing an overview of the concepts covered within the folder.

## Learning Topics

The following topics are covered in this repository:

### 1. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Understanding how to declare variables (`let`, `const`, `var`).
   - The different data types in JavaScript (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, etc.).

### 2. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
   - Assignment operators and their usage.

### 3. **Control Flow**
   - How to control the flow of execution using conditionals like `if`, `else`, `switch`, and the ternary operator.
   - Introduction to loops such as `for`, `while`, and `for...in`.

### 4. **Functions**
   - Writing and using functions.
   - Function parameters, return values, and scope.

### 5. **Objects**
   - Creating and manipulating JavaScript objects.
   - Understanding object properties and methods.

### 6. **Arrays**
   - Creating arrays and using built-in array methods (`push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, etc.).
   - Iterating over arrays and manipulating array elements.

### 7. **Loops**
   - Using different loops to iterate over data (for, while, forEach, etc.).
