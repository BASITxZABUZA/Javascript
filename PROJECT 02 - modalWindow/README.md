## About the Project:
[Preview project](https://modalwindowbybasit.netlify.app)
This is a simple project to demonstrate the creation and functionality of modal windows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use this modal code in your own project to easily implement modal windows with a clean user interface.

### How to Use:
1. Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code provided in this project.
2. In your own project, paste the HTML structure where you want the modal to appear.
3. Link the CSS file to style the modal window and layout.
4. Include the JavaScript file to handle the modal's behavior (showing and hiding the modals).
5. Modify the modal content (such as titles and descriptions) to match your projectâ€™s needs.
6. You can add more modals or buttons by duplicating the existing modal structure and modifying the JavaScript to handle additional modals if needed.

This modal code can be easily adapted to any project by copying the structure and making small adjustments to fit your design and functionality needs.
