Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ®
This project is a fun and interactive "Guess the Number" game. The player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a set range. The game provides feedback after each guess, helping the player get closer to the correct number.

Key Features:
A random number is generated at the start of each game.
The player has 20 attempts to guess the correct number.
Feedback on each guess guides the player (e.g., "too high" or "too low").
This project is a great introduction to JavaScript programming and showcases the use of core concepts like conditionals, loops, and random number generation
